# LinearEquationsSolver
This application solves systems of linear equations using [guassian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) and back substitution. It can determine whether a system of linear equations
has a specific solution, multiple solutions, or no solutions.

# Goal
The goal of this project was to reinforce the what I had been studying in my coursework over the past semester, namely linear algebra and intro to object-oriented programming. 

# Functionality
- Determine if linear system of equations has one solution, more than one solution, or no solutions
- Solve systems of linear equations involving floating point values
- Can solve linear systems of equations with M-variables and N-equations (rows != cols)

# What I learned
- How to implement guassian elimination algorithm
- Matrix operations
- Object-Oriented Design
- Exposure to Command design pattern
- Experience using Java

# How to get started
First, make sure you have java installed on your system. Java 15.0.1 will work, however any version of java later than java 8 will work (I think).

In order to run the program, navigate to the file main.java:
